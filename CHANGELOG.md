# Changelog

## Unreleased — integrated foundation

- Restored the earlier Photo, Notes, Print, Business and editor modules within current main's physically dimensioned Creative Studio workspace, without deleting earlier project files or replacing main's workflow.
- Added editable text/shapes/images, manipulation, history, local save/reopen and safe copy import/export; added bounded one-way `.dsproject` conversion and same-installation discovery.
- Added bounded local photo operations, repeated-photo sheet preview/PDF/print handoff, accurate PDF page geometry and injectable print adapter.
- Hardened local writes, failure/retry/unsaved-exit behavior, catalogue stock counting and exact minor-unit calculations; added catalogue and notes exports.
- Preserved current main's checked-in Android scaffold and package ID; debug builds are explicitly for testing and release signing requires a local private configuration. Corrected the build script's repository-root detection.
- Added host tests, offline/privacy/format/printing documentation, attribution and an inactive CI proposal.

Validation in this execution: Flutter 3.47.8 / Dart 3.13.7; formatter and analyzer passed and 44 integrated host tests passed sequentially. System-print tests use fakes. No integrated Android/desktop packaging, actual printer or device testing was performed. The earlier creative-branch debug APK is not this integration.
